Having completed the first 45% or so of The Odin Project's
"Foundations" course, I now embark on the creation of a website
detailing various recipes. This will demonstrate my burgeoning
talent in HTML. Years from now, when I am a highly paid and well
respected member of the coding community, I will revisit this
project and remember the disjointed intellectual journey that
brought me here.
