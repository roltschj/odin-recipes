  <h1>Spaghetti & Beans</h1>

  <h2>OBLIGATORY CONTENT PRECEDING USEFUL INFORMATION</h2>
  <p>Ahhh... the joy of spaghetti & beans. The mere mention of the words elicits
    a multitude of reactions among the listener. Shock, awe, disgust, confusion.
    Occasionally, delight. It's become something of a meme among my inner circle.
    But I haven't been eating it for 15 years because it's funny. I eat it because
    it is <strong>simple, cheap, quick, nutritious,</strong> and <strong>delicious</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The year was 2008. I was living in my first apartment with two friends, suddenly
    paying for everything rather than nothing. In search of a staple meal that
    satisfied the five qualifications previously mentioned, I dreamed this up. Whole
    grains paired with legumes form a complete protein. Complex carbohydrates keep you
    going. Leafy green vegetables are always a winner. Add a sauce of some kind and
    for less than two bucks and twenty minutes, you're good for half a day. Additionally,
    it's a modular meal. Change it up to avoid boredom.
  </p>
  <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 serving whole grain spaghetti
      <ul>
        <li>About the diameter of a quarter, when bunched in a circle. Go with your gut.</li>
        <li>I use thin spaghetti or cappellini - it cooks quickly!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 can Black beans, rinsed
      <ul>
        <li>Alternatively, chickpeas, pinto, kidney... any kind of bean, really. It's up to you.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      4-8 oz. spinach, washed
      <ul>
        <li>Seriously, such a  quantity will cook down to the size of a single leaf. Go wild.</li>
        <li>
          Alternatively, collard greens, turnip greens, mustard greens... the possibilities
          are endless.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sauce (see <a href="#sauces">A Note On Sauces</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>THE METHOD</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Bring a salty pot of water to a boil. While you're doing that, heat up a pan. Add a little
      bit of oil to both.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I use canola oil for its neutral flavor, but here, too, you can use anything you like.
          This is a judgment-free zone.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add spaghetti and beans to the boiling water. While it cooks, Saute the greens.</li>
    <li>
      While the grains, beans & greens are cooking, determine and actualize your
      <a href="#sauces">sauce situation</a>.
    </li>
    <li>When the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and return it to the pot.</li>
    <li>Mix in greens and sauce, and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="sauces">A NOTE ON SAUCES</h2>
  <p>
    Here is where the dish's flavor is determined. Cooked spaghetti and beans, in and of themselves,
    have a very neutral flavor. I will now discuss two options, but the subjective nature of taste,
    paired with the aforementioned modularity of this dish, necessitates and enables experimentation
    with various <em>accoutrements</em> to find your preferred flavor profile. If you're in a hurry,
    though, go with Option 1.
  </p>
  <h3>Option 1</h3>
  <p>Store-bought pasta sauce. Season to taste.</p>
  <h3>Option 2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/3 cup nutritional yeast</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since tahini is quite thick, it is best to first mix it in with the pasta just after draining,
    as the high temperature will loosen it up a bit. So too will the soy sauce, but be careful about
    adding too much- an overabundance of sodium is never a good time.
